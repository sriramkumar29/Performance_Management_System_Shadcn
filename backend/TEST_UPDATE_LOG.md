## 2025-09-04 — Initial migration of test updates and summary

Summary

- Brought the backend test workflow into a reproducible state in the `backend` virtual environment.
- Ran and debugged unit tests for the date calculation utility. Found a logic bug and fixed it.
- Reworked integration tests for appraisal types to run without a real DB by overriding FastAPI dependencies and using AsyncMock for async DB calls.
- Verified the updated route tests pass locally.

Files changed

- `app/utils/date_calculator.py` — fixed control flow to correctly handle tri-annual vs annual and require appraisal ranges only where appropriate.
- `test_date_calculator.py` — added lightweight helpers (SimpleNamespace) so tests can call the date calculator without ORM model instances.
- `test_appraisal_types.py` — updated tests to:
  - use `client.app.dependency_overrides` to bypass authentication and inject a mocked_async_db session,
  - use `AsyncMock` for `execute()` so `await db.execute(...)` works,
  - return plain `dict` entries that match the Pydantic response models (including `start_month_offset`/`end_month_offset`).

Commands run (from `backend`)

- Activate venv (PowerShell):
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
- Run date calculator tests:
  python -m pytest test_date_calculator.py -q
- Run appraisal-types route tests:
  python -m pytest test_appraisal_types.py -q

Test results (selected)

- `test_date_calculator.py` — 9 passed, 1 warning (after fix to `date_calculator.py`).
- `test_appraisal_types.py` — 4 passed, 17 warnings (Pydantic deprecation warnings). Verified 2025-09-04.

Notes

- Pydantic shows several deprecation warnings (v1-style validators). Consider migrating schemas to Pydantic v2 patterns in a follow-up.
- The helper approach in tests purposely avoids depending on the real DB; it makes tests faster and isolated.

Next steps

- Run the full backend test suite and address any remaining failures or warnings.
- (Optional) Add a git hook or CI step to run `backend/scripts/append_test_log.py` to auto-append entries when test-related files change.

## 2025-09-04 00:00:00 UTC — Verified appraisal-route tests

Summary

- Re-ran and verified the `appraisal-types` route tests after updating the test harness to bypass auth and mock the async DB session.

Files changed

- `test_appraisal_types.py` — tests updated to use `client.app.dependency_overrides`, `AsyncMock` for async DB `execute()`, and dict-based mocked rows matching Pydantic response models.
- `backend/scripts/append_test_log.py` — helper script added to make appending timestamped entries to this log easy.

Commands run (from `backend`)

- Activate venv (PowerShell):
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
- Run appraisal-types route tests:
  python -m pytest test_appraisal_types.py -q

Test results

- `test_appraisal_types.py` — 4 passed, 17 warnings (Pydantic deprecation warnings).

Notes

- The append helper script was created but a prior attempt to run it was interrupted; this entry is added manually to ensure the log is up to date.
- Pydantic v1-style validators produce deprecation warnings; consider migrating to Pydantic v2 in a follow-up.

Next steps

- Use `backend/scripts/append_test_log.py` to add future test-update entries automatically after test runs, or edit this file manually.

Key Issues Fixed

1. **Authentication Issues**: 
   - Problem: All endpoints returned 401 Unauthorized
   - Solution: Implemented `app.dependency_overrides[get_current_user]` pattern
   - Result: Authentication now works across all test suites

2. **Async Database Mocking**:
   - Problem: `AsyncMock` operations not properly configured
   - Solution: Created `_create_mock_session()` helper with proper `AsyncMock` setup
   - Result: Database operations work correctly in tests

3. **Response Validation Errors**:
   - Problem: Mock data missing required Pydantic schema fields
   - Solution: Added all required fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`, etc.) to mock objects
   - Result: Response serialization works correctly

4. **Enum Value Mismatches**:
   - Problem: Tests expected "DRAFT" but API returns "Draft"
   - Solution: Updated tests to use correct `AppraisalStatus` enum values
   - Result: Status handling works correctly

5. **Model Field Corrections**:
   - Problem: Tests used incorrect field names (e.g., `start_date` vs `start_month_offset`)
   - Solution: Updated tests to match actual model definitions
   - Result: Model instantiation works correctly

6. **Missing Endpoint Implementation**:
   - Problem: `/api/employees/managers` endpoint didn't exist
   - Solution: Added proper endpoint implementation with filtering logic
   - Result: Managers endpoint now functional

Technical Patterns Established

- **Dependency Override Pattern**: `app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = lambda: mock_session`
- **Mock Data Structure**: Using `SimpleNamespace` for realistic mock objects
- **Database Result Mocking**: `_make_result()` helper supporting `.scalars().all()/.first()` and `.scalar()`
- **Async Session Mocking**: Proper `AsyncMock` configuration for all session methods
- **Test Isolation**: Try/finally blocks ensuring proper cleanup of overrides

Notes

- All test suites now follow consistent, proven patterns
- Significant reduction in test failures across the board
- Auth tests still have 2 remaining async mock issues being resolved
- Pydantic v1 deprecation warnings present but not blocking functionality
- Test execution time improved due to proper mocking (no real DB connections)

Next steps

- Complete auth test fixes for remaining 2 failing tests
- Consider migrating Pydantic schemas to v2 to resolve deprecation warnings
- Add comprehensive integration test suite
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated test execution
