# Reviewer Overall Rating & Comments Section Added

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Component**: `frontend/src/components/AppraisalWorkflow.tsx`

## Changes Made

Added the missing **Overall Rating and Comments** section specifically for the **Reviewer Evaluation** mode.

### What Was Added

Two new card sections that appear ONLY when `mode === "reviewer-evaluation"`:

#### 1. Appraiser Overall Assessment (Read-Only)

- **Purpose**: Display the appraiser's overall rating and comments for the reviewer to see
- **Features**:
  - Overall rating slider (disabled/read-only)
  - Rating badge showing value (e.g., "4/5")
  - Overall comments textarea (disabled/read-only)
  - Uses UserCheck icon and standard card styling

#### 2. Your Reviewer Assessment (Editable)

- **Purpose**: Allow the reviewer to provide their own overall rating and comments
- **Features**:
  - Interactive rating slider (1-5 scale)
  - Rating badge showing current selection
  - Large textarea for comprehensive comments (6 rows)
  - Character counter
  - Highlighted with primary border and background (`border-primary/20 bg-primary/5`)
  - Placeholder text guiding the reviewer

### UI Design

Both sections follow the same compact, modern design as the rest of the unified component:

- **Consistent styling** with goal cards
- **Icons**: Star for ratings, MessageSquare for comments, UserCheck for section headers
- **Color coding**:
  - Appraiser section: Standard border (read-only feel)
  - Reviewer section: Primary-colored border/background (editable feel)
- **Rating slider labels**: Poor → Below Avg → Average → Good → Excellent
- **Responsive badges** showing current rating value

### Location

The sections are added **after all goal cards** and **before the Unsaved Changes Dialog**, appearing at the bottom of the main content area.

### State Management

The component already had the `reviewerOverall` state:

```typescript
const [reviewerOverall, setReviewerOverall] = useState<{
  rating: number | null;
  comment: string;
}>({ rating: null, comment: "" });
```

This state is now properly connected to the UI inputs.

### Validation

The existing validation logic checks that both rating and comment are provided before submission:

```typescript
if (!reviewerOverall.rating || !reviewerOverall.comment.trim()) {
  toast.error("Please provide overall rating and comment");
  return;
}
```

### API Integration

The overall rating and comments are included in the submit payload:

```typescript
payload.reviewer_overall_rating = reviewerOverall.rating;
payload.reviewer_overall_comments = reviewerOverall.comment;
```
