## Testing Checklist (Ready for QA)

### Create Template Flow

- [ ] Open CreateTemplateModal
- [ ] Fill all required fields including weightage (1-100%)
- [ ] Try invalid weightage (0, 101, negative) - should show error
- [ ] Try valid weightage (e.g., 20) - should accept
- [ ] Add categories using Enter key
- [ ] Submit and verify template is created with weightage
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet

### Edit Template Flow

- [ ] Open EditTemplateModal for existing template
- [ ] Verify weightage is pre-filled from template
- [ ] Modify weightage to new value
- [ ] Try invalid weightage - should show error
- [ ] Submit and verify template is updated
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet

### Import Template Flow

- [ ] Open ImportFromTemplateModal in Create/Edit Appraisal
- [ ] Select a template - verify default weightage is shown
- [ ] Use default weightage without modification
- [ ] Import successfully
- [ ] Select another template
- [ ] Override the weightage with custom value
- [ ] Verify validation against remaining weightage
- [ ] Import successfully with custom weightage
- [ ] Try exceeding remaining weightage - should show error
- [ ] Test with multiple templates (mixed default/custom)
- [ ] Verify total weightage calculation
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet

### UI/UX Testing

- [ ] All modals have consistent gradient headers
- [ ] Card-based layouts render correctly
- [ ] Focus states work properly on all inputs
- [ ] Hover effects on buttons are smooth
- [ ] Form validation shows appropriate error messages
- [ ] Success/error toasts display correctly
- [ ] Loading states show during API calls
- [ ] Cancel/close buttons work as expected
- [ ] Modals are responsive on all screen sizes

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Create template with minimum weightage (1%)
- [ ] Create template with maximum weightage (100%)
- [ ] Import when remaining weightage is very small
- [ ] Import multiple templates totaling exactly 100%
- [ ] Try to import when no weightage remaining
- [ ] Test with very long template titles/descriptions
- [ ] Test with many categories
