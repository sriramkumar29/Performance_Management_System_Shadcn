# Overall Assessment Button Added to Appraisal View

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Component:** `frontend/src/components/AppraisalWorkflow.tsx`

## Summary

Added the overall assessment square select button to the navigation bar in appraisal-view mode, making it consistent with appraiser-evaluation and reviewer-evaluation modes.

---

## Change Details

### Problem

The overall assessment square select button in the top navigation bar was only visible in:

- ✅ Appraiser Evaluation mode
- ✅ Reviewer Evaluation mode
- ❌ Appraisal View mode (missing)

This created an inconsistent user experience where users couldn't quickly navigate to the overall assessment section when viewing completed appraisals.

### Solution

Extended the conditional rendering to include `appraisal-view` mode and adjusted the button styling logic.

            ? appraiserOverall.rating &&
              appraiserOverall.comment.trim()
            : reviewerOverall.rating &&
              reviewerOverall.comment.trim()

        : "bg-purple-500"
    } flex items-center justify-center shadow-md ${
      openOverallAssessment
        ? "ring-2 ring-primary ring-offset-2"
        : ""
    }`}
    title="Overall Assessment"
    aria-label="Overall Assessment"
  >
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Conditional Rendering

**Added:** `mode === "appraisal-view"` to the condition

```typescript
// Before
{(mode === "appraiser-evaluation" || mode === "reviewer-evaluation") && (

// After
{(mode === "appraiser-evaluation" ||
  mode === "reviewer-evaluation" ||
  mode === "appraisal-view") && (
```

### 2. Button Color Logic

**Enhanced:** Special handling for appraisal-view mode

```typescript
mode === "appraisal-view"
  ? "bg-purple-500" // Always purple for appraisal-view
  : (
    // Existing logic for other modes
  )
```

**Rationale:**

- In appraisal-view mode, the button is read-only navigation
- No completion status to track (all data is final)
- Purple color indicates neutral/informational state
- Consistent with the mode's read-only nature

## Button Color States

### Appraisal View Mode

| State   | Color                  | Meaning           |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Default | Purple (bg-purple-500) | Navigation button |
| Open    | Purple + Ring          | Currently viewing |

### Appraiser/Reviewer Evaluation Modes

| State         | Color                  | Meaning                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Completed     | Green (bg-green-500)   | Rating & comment provided |
| Active (Open) | Orange (bg-orange-500) | Currently editing         |
| Incomplete    | Purple (bg-purple-500) | Not yet filled            |

---

## Behavior

### Navigation Flow

1. **Click button:** Toggles overall assessment card open/closed
2. **When opening:** Automatically scrolls to overall assessment section
3. **Visual feedback:** Ring appears around button when section is open
4. **Smooth scroll:** 100ms delay for smooth animation

### User Experience

- **Consistency:** Same navigation pattern across all modes that show overall assessment
- **Quick Access:** Single click to jump to overall assessment
- **Visual State:** Ring indicates current section being viewed
- **Accessibility:** Proper ARIA labels and title attributes

---

## Navigation Bar Layout

The complete navigation bar now shows:

```
[←] [Title]    [1] [2] [3] ... [N] [O]    [Save & Close] [Submit]
                ↑              ↑   ↑       ↑              ↑
                Goal squares   |   Overall Assessment     Action buttons
                              New button for appraisal-view
```

### Button Position

- **Location:** After all goal squares, before action buttons
- **Center-aligned:** Part of the centered navigation group
- **Consistent spacing:** 2px gap (gap-2) between squares
