# Appraiser Overall Assessment Added

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Component**: `frontend/src/components/AppraisalWorkflow.tsx`

## Overview

Added **Overall Assessment** functionality to the **Appraiser Evaluation** mode, matching the existing reviewer evaluation implementation. The appraiser can now provide an overall rating and comments after evaluating all individual goals.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Management

Added new state for appraiser overall assessment:

```typescript
const [appraiserOverall, setAppraiserOverall] = useState<{
  rating: number | null;
  comment: string;
}>({ rating: null, comment: "" });
```

### 2. Data Loading

Added loading of appraiser overall data when in appraiser-evaluation mode:

```typescript
if (mode === "appraiser-evaluation") {
  setAppraiserOverall({
    rating: res.data.appraiser_overall_rating ?? null,
    comment: res.data.appraiser_overall_comments ?? "",
  });
}
```

### 3. Submission Logic

Added validation and payload inclusion for appraiser overall assessment:

```typescript
if (mode === "appraiser-evaluation") {
  if (!appraiserOverall.rating || !appraiserOverall.comment.trim()) {
    toast.error("Please provide overall rating and comment");
    return;
  }
  payload.appraiser_overall_rating = appraiserOverall.rating;
  payload.appraiser_overall_comments = appraiserOverall.comment;
}
```

### 4. Navigation Button

Updated the overall assessment button to show for both modes:

- **Appraiser Mode**: Shows purple button that turns green when complete
- **Reviewer Mode**: Same behavior as before
- Button color logic checks the appropriate state based on mode

### 5. Overall Assessment Card

Made the card dynamic based on mode:

#### Appraiser Evaluation Mode

- **Single editable section**: "Your Overall Assessment"
- Interactive rating slider (1-5)
- Large textarea for comprehensive comments
- Character counter
- Highlighted with primary colors

#### Reviewer Evaluation Mode

- **Two sections**:
  1. Appraiser Overall Assessment (read-only display)
  2. Your Reviewer Assessment (editable)

### 6. Status Badge

The status badge in the card header now checks the appropriate state:

- **Appraiser mode**: Checks `appraiserOverall.rating` and `appraiserOverall.comment`
- **Reviewer mode**: Checks `reviewerOverall.rating` and `reviewerOverall.comment`
- Shows "Pending" (amber) or "Completed" (green)
