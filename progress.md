```typescript
// Request interception for API routing
await page.route("**/api/**", async (route) => {
  const url = route.request().url();
  const newUrl = url.replace("localhost:7000", "localhost:7001");
  await route.continue({ url: newUrl });
});

// Updated credentials
email: "john.ceo@example.com";

3. **Testing**: Original failing tests should then pass automatically

#### Technical Debt - RESOLVED

✅ **Schema Alignment**: All database tables properly created and seeded  
✅ **Error Messaging**: Business rule messages working correctly  
✅ **Page Object Models**: Updated with accurate selectors  
✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive E2E framework operational

#### Future Enhancements
