# Self Assessment Readonly View Fix

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Component:** `frontend/src/components/AppraisalWorkflow.tsx`

## Summary

Fixed an issue where appraisees could not view their self-assessment in readonly mode when the appraisal status was "Appraiser Evaluation" or "Reviewer Evaluation". The status validation was incorrectly blocking readonly access.

---

## Problem Description

### Issue

Appraisees were unable to view their submitted self-assessment when the appraisal moved to:

- **Appraiser Evaluation** stage
- **Reviewer Evaluation** stage

### Expected Behavior

- Appraisee should be able to view their self-assessment in **readonly mode** at any stage after submission
- The "View" button in MyAppraisal page should allow access to self-assessment with `?readonly=true` parameter

### Actual Behavior

- Clicking "View" button redirected user to home page with toast message: "This appraisal is in 'Appraiser Evaluation' stage"
- Self-assessment was inaccessible even though data was present

### Root Cause

The `load` function in AppraisalWorkflow component had a status validation that blocked loading when the appraisal status didn't match the mode's `allowedStatuses`:

```typescript
// Status guard
if (!config.allowedStatuses.includes(res.data.status)) {
  toast.info(`This appraisal is in '${res.data.status}' stage`);
  navigate("/");
  setLoading(false);
  return;
}
```

For self-assessment mode:

- **allowedStatuses:** `["Appraisee Self Assessment"]`
- **Attempted access during:** `"Appraiser Evaluation"` or `"Reviewer Evaluation"`
- **Result:** Status check failed → redirect to home

---

## Solution

### Code Change

**File:** `frontend/src/components/AppraisalWorkflow.tsx`  
**Line:** ~237

**Before:**

```typescript
if (res.ok && res.data) {
  setAppraisal(res.data);

  // Status guard
  if (!config.allowedStatuses.includes(res.data.status)) {
    toast.info(`This appraisal is in '${res.data.status}' stage`);
    navigate("/");
    setLoading(false);
    return;
  }

  // Seed form from existing inputs
  const initial: FormState = {};
  const openState: Record<number, boolean> = {};
```

**After:**

```typescript
if (res.ok && res.data) {
  setAppraisal(res.data);

  // Status guard - skip validation in readonly mode
  if (!isReadOnly && !config.allowedStatuses.includes(res.data.status)) {
    toast.info(`This appraisal is in '${res.data.status}' stage`);
    navigate("/");
    setLoading(false);
    return;
  }

  // Seed form from existing inputs
  const initial: FormState = {};
  const openState: Record<number, boolean> = {};
```

### Change Summary

Added `!isReadOnly &&` condition to skip status validation when viewing in readonly mode.

**Logic:**

- **Editable mode (`isReadOnly = false`):** Enforce status validation (existing behavior)
- **Readonly mode (`isReadOnly = true`):** Skip status validation (new behavior)

---

## How It Works

### User Flow (Appraisee)

#### 1. Submit Self Assessment

```
Status: "Appraisee Self Assessment"
Action: Complete and submit self-assessment
Result: Status changes to "Appraiser Evaluation"
```

#### 2. View Self Assessment (During Appraiser Evaluation)

```
Current Status: "Appraiser Evaluation"
Action: Click "View" button in MyAppraisal page
URL: /self-assessment/{id}?readonly=true
Component: AppraisalWorkflow with mode="self-assessment" isReadOnly={true}
```

**Previous behavior:**

```
1. Load appraisal data
2. Check status: "Appraiser Evaluation" ∉ ["Appraisee Self Assessment"]
3. Show toast: "This appraisal is in 'Appraiser Evaluation' stage"
4. Redirect to home page ❌
```

**New behavior:**

```
1. Load appraisal data
2. Check isReadOnly: true → Skip status validation ✓
3. Display self-assessment in readonly mode ✅
```

#### 3. View Self Assessment (During Reviewer Evaluation)

```
Current Status: "Reviewer Evaluation"
Action: Click "View" button in MyAppraisal page
URL: /self-assessment/{id}?readonly=true
Result: Self-assessment displayed in readonly mode ✅
```

---

## Integration Points

### MyAppraisal Page

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/my-appraisal/MyAppraisal.tsx`  
**Lines:** 320-332

```typescript
// Appraisee can view their self assessment during Appraiser/Reviewer Evaluation
if (
  isAppraisee &&
  (appraisal.status === "Appraiser Evaluation" ||
    appraisal.status === "Reviewer Evaluation")
) {
  return (
    <Button
      variant={BUTTON_STYLES.VIEW.variant}
      onClick={() =>
        navigate(`/self-assessment/${appraisal.appraisal_id}?readonly=true`)
      }
      className={BUTTON_STYLES.VIEW.className}
      aria-label="View self assessment"
      title="View self assessment"
    >
      <span className="hidden sm:inline">View</span>
      <ArrowRight className={`${ICON_SIZES.DEFAULT} sm:ml-2`} />
    </Button>
  );
}
```

This code was already present but wasn't working due to the status validation bug.

### SelfAssessmentNew Component

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/self-assessment/SelfAssessmentNew.tsx`

```typescript
const SelfAssessment = () => {
  const { id } = useParams();
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const isReadOnly = searchParams.get("readonly") === "true";

  if (!id) {
    return <div>Appraisal ID not found</div>;
  }

  return (
    <AppraisalWorkflow
      appraisalId={id}
      mode="self-assessment"
      isReadOnly={isReadOnly} // Passed from URL parameter
    />
  );
};
```

### AppraisalWorkflow Component

Receives `isReadOnly` prop and now correctly bypasses status validation when true.

## Affected Workflows

### Self Assessment Readonly View

| Status                        | Editable Access  | Readonly Access             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Appraisee Self Assessment** | ✅ Yes (default) | ✅ Yes (fixed)              |
| **Appraiser Evaluation**      | ❌ No (blocked)  | ✅ Yes (fixed)              |
| **Reviewer Evaluation**       | ❌ No (blocked)  | ✅ Yes (fixed)              |
| **Complete**                  | ❌ No (blocked)  | ✅ Yes (via appraisal-view) |

### Other Modes (No Change)

- **Appraiser Evaluation:** Still validates status correctly
- **Reviewer Evaluation:** Still validates status correctly
- **Appraisal View:** Always readonly, no status restrictions

---

## Readonly Mode Behavior

### UI Changes in Readonly Mode

1. **All inputs disabled:** Sliders, textareas, rating buttons
2. **No Save button:** "Save & Close" hidden
3. **No Submit button:** "Submit Assessment" hidden
4. **Back button only:** Navigate back to MyAppraisal
5. **Status badge:** Shows "Not Rated" for missing values
6. **Visual indicators:** Gray/disabled styling

### Data Access

- **Read-only access** to all self-assessment data
- **No modifications** allowed to ratings or comments
- **No API calls** for save/submit operations

---

## Security Considerations

### Status Validation Still Active

- Status validation **remains active** for editable modes
- Users cannot edit appraisals in wrong status stages
- Readonly mode is safe - no data modification possible

### Access Control

The fix only affects **view permissions**, not **edit permissions**:

| Mode         | Status Check | Data Modification            |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Editable** | ✅ Enforced  | ✅ Allowed (if status valid) |
| **Readonly** | ❌ Bypassed  | ❌ Never allowed             |

### API Security

- Backend still enforces proper authorization
- Frontend readonly mode is UI-only protection
- API endpoints validate user permissions
