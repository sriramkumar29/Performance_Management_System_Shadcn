# Self Assessment Page Redesign

## Overview

Complete redesign of the Self Assessment page with improved UX and modern collapsible card interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Layout Changes**

- ✅ **5cm Card Margins**: All content now has 5cm margin (using `padding: 0 5cm`)
- ✅ **Removed Header Card**: Header section no longer wrapped in a card for cleaner look
- ✅ **Back Button**: Replaced "Go Home" button with back button using `navigate(-1)`

### 2. **Navigation Improvements**

- ✅ **Collapsible Goal Cards**: Each goal is now a collapsible card instead of pagination
- ✅ **All Goals Visible**: Users can see all goals at once and expand/collapse them
- ✅ **First Goal Open by Default**: First goal card opens automatically on load

### 3. **Visual Indicators**

- ✅ **Complete/Pending Badges**:
  - Green "Complete" badge (with CheckCircle2 icon) when rating and comment are filled
  - Amber "Pending" badge (with Clock icon) when incomplete
- ✅ **Visible in Collapsed State**: Badges show in card header even when collapsed
- ✅ **Rating Badge**: Shows current rating in collapsed state

### 4. **Action Buttons**

- ✅ **Save Progress Button**: New "Save" button to save without submitting
- ✅ **Submit Assessment Button**: Only enabled when all goals are complete
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Shows "X of Y Goals Complete" and percentage

### 5. **Progress Tracking**

- ✅ **Completion Count**: Header shows "X of Y Goals Complete"
- ✅ **Progress Bar**: Visual progress bar based on completed goals (not pagination)
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Progress updates as user fills goals

### 6. **Improved User Experience**

- ✅ **No Forced Sequential Flow**: Users can jump to any goal
- ✅ **Auto-expand Incomplete**: When submitting with incomplete goals, first incomplete goal auto-expands
- ✅ **Persistent Data**: Save button allows saving partial progress without validation
- ✅ **Better Mobile Support**: Collapsible cards work better on mobile

## Technical Implementation

### New Dependencies

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-collapsible
```

### New Components

- `frontend/src/components/ui/collapsible.tsx` - Radix UI collapsible wrapper

### State Management

- **openGoals**: Record<number, boolean> - Tracks which goals are expanded/collapsed
- **saving**: boolean - Separate loading state for save vs submit operations
- **completedCount**: useMemo - Calculates completed goals in real-time

### New Functions

- `toggleGoal(goalId)` - Toggles goal card open/closed
- `isGoalComplete(goalId)` - Checks if a goal has rating and comment
- `handleSave()` - Saves partial progress without validation
- Enhanced `handleSubmit()` - Auto-expands first incomplete goal on validation error

## Before vs After

### Before

- Single goal shown at a time
- Previous/Next buttons for navigation
- Sequential workflow (must complete current to proceed)
- Home button in header
- Header wrapped in card
- No way to save partial progress

### After

- All goals visible as collapsible cards
- Click to expand/collapse any goal
- Non-linear workflow (jump to any goal)
- Back button (navigate(-1))
- Clean header without card wrapper
- Save button for partial progress
- Complete/Pending badges on each goal
- Overall completion tracking

## Benefits

1. **Better Overview**: Users see all goals at once
2. **Flexible Workflow**: Users can complete goals in any order
3. **Clear Status**: Visual badges show completion status
4. **Save Progress**: Don't lose work if interrupted
5. **Better Mobile**: Collapsible cards scroll better than pagination
6. **Cleaner Design**: 5cm margins + no header card = more modern look
