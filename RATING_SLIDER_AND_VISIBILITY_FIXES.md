# Rating Slider and Visibility Fixes

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Component:** `frontend/src/components/AppraisalWorkflow.tsx`

## Summary

Fixed three critical issues in the AppraisalWorkflow component:

1. Rating slider default values changed from 3 (Average) to 1 (Poor) for goals
2. Self-assessment section visibility improved in readonly mode
3. Overall assessment section now visible in appraisal-view mode

---

## Issue 1: Rating Slider Default Value

### Problem

Rating sliders for goals were defaulting to 3 (Average) instead of 1 (Poor) in self-assessment and appraiser evaluation modes.

### Root Cause

- Form initialization was setting `rating: 3` as default instead of `null`
- Slider fallback values were set to `[1]` but form state was `3`
- Created inconsistency and didn't match user expectation

### Solution

Changed the form initialization to default to `null` instead of `3`:

**Before:**

```typescript
initial[ag.goal.goal_id] = {
  rating: ratingField ? (ag as any)[ratingField] ?? 3 : null, // Default to 3 (Average)
  comment: commentField ? (ag as any)[commentField] ?? "" : "",
};
```

**After:**

```typescript
initial[ag.goal.goal_id] = {
  rating: ratingField ? (ag as any)[ratingField] ?? null : null, // Default to null
  comment: commentField ? (ag as any)[commentField] ?? "" : "",
};
```

### Impact

- **Self Assessment Mode:** New goals without ratings will show slider at position 1 (Poor)
- **Appraiser Evaluation Mode:** New goals without ratings will show slider at position 1 (Poor)
- **User Experience:** Users must actively select a rating, starting from the minimum value
- **Data Integrity:** No automatic default value imposed; explicit user action required

---

## Issue 2: Self-Assessment Visibility in Readonly Mode

### Problem

Self-assessment section wasn't clearly visible in appraisal-view mode when ratings hadn't been provided yet.

### Root Cause

- Rating badge only showed when there was a value
- Slider always displayed even when rating was null
- No indication that rating was "Not Rated"

### Solution

Enhanced the display logic to show "Not Rated" badge and conditionally hide slider:

**Before:**

```typescript
{(config.editableSelfSection
  ? form[goalId]?.rating
  : ag.self_rating) && (
  <Badge variant="outline" className="bg-emerald-50 text-emerald-700 border-emerald-200">
    {config.editableSelfSection ? form[goalId]?.rating : ag.self_rating}/5
  </Badge>
)}
<div className="px-3">
  <Slider ... />
</div>
```

**After:**

```typescript
{config.editableSelfSection ? (
  form[goalId]?.rating && (
    <Badge variant="outline" className="bg-emerald-50 text-emerald-700 border-emerald-200">
      {form[goalId]?.rating}/5
    </Badge>
  )
) : ag.self_rating ? (
  <Badge variant="outline" className="bg-emerald-50 text-emerald-700 border-emerald-200">
    {ag.self_rating}/5
  </Badge>
) : (
  <Badge variant="outline" className="bg-gray-50 text-gray-600 border-gray-200">
    Not Rated
  </Badge>
)}
{(config.editableSelfSection || ag.self_rating) && (
  <div className="px-3">
    <Slider ... />
  </div>
)}
```

### Impact

- **Appraisal View Mode:**
  - Shows "Not Rated" badge when self-rating is missing
  - Hides slider when there's no rating to display
  - Clearer visual indication of incomplete assessments
- **Appraiser Evaluation Mode:**
  - Same improvements for viewing employee's self-assessment
  - Better readability when reviewing submitted assessments

### Applied To

- Self Assessment section (Employee ratings)
- Appraiser Evaluation section (Appraiser ratings)

## Issue 3: Overall Assessment Not Visible in Appraisal View

### Problem

Overall assessment section was only visible in appraiser-evaluation and reviewer-evaluation modes, not in appraisal-view mode.

### Root Cause

Conditional rendering excluded appraisal-view mode:

```typescript
{(mode === "appraiser-evaluation" || mode === "reviewer-evaluation") && ...}
```

### Solution

#### Step 1: Updated Conditional Rendering

**Before:**

```typescript
{(mode === "appraiser-evaluation" || mode === "reviewer-evaluation") && appraisal && (
  <div className="mt-6" id="overall-assessment-card">
```

**After:**

```typescript
{(mode === "appraiser-evaluation" ||
  mode === "reviewer-evaluation" ||
  mode === "appraisal-view") &&
  appraisal && (
  <div className="mt-6" id="overall-assessment-card">
```

#### Step 2: Added Appraisal-View Section Logic

Enhanced the content logic to handle three modes:

**Structure:**

```typescript
{mode === "appraiser-evaluation" ? (
  /* Editable appraiser section */
) : mode === "reviewer-evaluation" ? (
  /* Two sections: read-only appraiser + editable reviewer */
) : (
  /* Appraisal-view: All read-only sections */
)}
```

**Appraisal-View Implementation:**

```typescript
<>
  {/* Appraiser Overall Assessment - Read Only */}
  {appraisal.appraiser_overall_rating && (
    <div className="rounded-lg border border-border/50 bg-background p-4 space-y-4">
      {/* Display appraiser rating and comments as read-only */}
    </div>
  )}

  {/* Reviewer Overall Assessment - Read Only */}
  {appraisal.reviewer_overall_rating && (
    <div className="rounded-lg border border-border/50 bg-background p-4 space-y-4">
      {/* Display reviewer rating and comments as read-only */}
    </div>
  )}
</>
```

#### Step 3: Updated Status Badge Logic

Removed status badges (Pending/Completed) from appraisal-view mode since it's read-only:

**Before:**

```typescript
{mode === "appraiser-evaluation" ? (
  /* Show Pending/Completed badge */
) : (
  /* Show Pending/Completed badge */
)}
```

**After:**

```typescript
{mode !== "appraisal-view" && (
  <>
    {mode === "appraiser-evaluation" ? (
      /* Show Pending/Completed badge */
    ) : (
      /* Show Pending/Completed badge */
    )}
  </>
)}
```

### Impact

- **Appraisal View Mode:**

  - Overall Assessment card now visible
  - Shows appraiser overall rating and comments (if available)
  - Shows reviewer overall rating and comments (if available)
  - Both sections read-only with disabled sliders
  - No Pending/Completed badges (since it's view-only)
  - Sections conditionally display only if data exists

- **User Experience:**
  - Complete appraisal information visible in one place
  - Clear hierarchy: Employee → Appraiser → Reviewer
  - Professional presentation for completed appraisals
  - Easy to review entire appraisal history

## Additional Changes

### Overall Assessment Default Values

Also updated overall assessment slider defaults to match goal rating defaults:

**Before:**

```typescript
value={[appraiserOverall.rating ?? 3]}  // Defaulted to 3 (Average)
value={[reviewerOverall.rating ?? 3]}   // Defaulted to 3 (Average)
```

**After:**

```typescript
value={[appraiserOverall.rating ?? 1]}  // Defaults to 1 (Poor)
value={[reviewerOverall.rating ?? 1]}   // Defaults to 1 (Poor)
```

### Initial State Values

Updated initial state to use 1 instead of 3:

```typescript
const [appraiserOverall, setAppraiserOverall] = useState({
  rating: 1, // Changed from 3
  comment: "",
});

const [reviewerOverall, setReviewerOverall] = useState({
  rating: 1, // Changed from 3
  comment: "",
});
```

## Rationale

### Why Start at 1 (Poor)?

1. **Neutral Baseline:** Forces explicit rating selection
2. **No Assumptions:** Doesn't assume average performance
3. **Data Integrity:** Null values clearly indicate "not rated"
4. **User Intent:** Makes users consciously choose rating
5. **Industry Standard:** Many performance systems start at minimum

### Why Show "Not Rated"?

1. **Clarity:** Clear indication of missing data
2. **Transparency:** No confusion about incomplete assessments
3. **Professional:** Better than showing default slider position
4. **Accountability:** Makes incomplete sections obvious

### Why Include Overall Assessment in Appraisal-View?

1. **Completeness:** Full appraisal picture in one view
2. **Convenience:** No need to switch modes to see overall ratings
3. **Documentation:** Complete record for export/printing
4. **User Experience:** Expected behavior for "view" mode
