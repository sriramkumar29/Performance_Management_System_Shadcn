## Test File Location

`frontend/src/features/appraisal/__tests__/AppraisalCreationRBAC.test.tsx`

## Test Results

- **Test Files:** 1 passed
- **Tests:** 21 passed (100% pass rate) ✅
- **Duration:** ~2 seconds
- **Framework:** Vitest with React Testing Library

## Test Coverage

### TC-B02.1: Authorized Manager Creates Appraisal ✅

**Condition:** Only authorized roles can create Appraisal (Manager, level=3)

**Tests Implemented:**

1. ✅ `should display Create Appraisal button for Manager (level=3)`
   - Verifies button is visible for managers
   - Checks button is not disabled
2. ✅ `should allow Manager to initiate appraisal creation`
   - Simulates clicking the create button
   - Verifies no errors occur during interaction

**Expected Output:** Appraisal creation button is visible and functional for managers.

---

### TC-B02.1-N1: Unauthorized Employee Cannot Create Appraisal ✅

**Condition:** Unauthorized user (Employee, level=1) attempts to create Appraisal

**Tests Implemented:**

1. ✅ `should NOT display Create Appraisal button for Employee (level=1)`
   - Verifies button does not exist in DOM
   - Checks component renders null for employees
2. ✅ `should prevent Employee from accessing create functionality`
   - Verifies no appraisal creation UI elements are present
   - Ensures complete access denial

**Expected Output:** System prevents access by not rendering any UI elements.

---

### TC-B02.2: Manager Level Enforcement ✅

**Condition:** Only managers (level ≥3) can create Appraisal

**Tests Implemented:**

1. ✅ `should allow Manager (level=3) to create appraisal`
   - Tests exact level 3 threshold
2. ✅ `should allow Director (level=4) to create appraisal`
   - Tests higher level access (level 4)
3. ✅ `should allow role-based access for recognized manager roles`
   - Tests all recognized roles: Manager, Lead, Head, Director, VP, Chief, CTO, CEO, Admin
   - Verifies role name takes precedence over level

**Expected Output:** All users with level ≥3 OR recognized manager role names can create appraisals.

---

### TC-B02.2-N1: Insufficient Role Level ✅

**Condition:** User with level <3 attempts to create Appraisal

**Tests Implemented:**

1. ✅ `should NOT allow Supervisor (level=2) to create appraisal`
   - Tests level 2 (Senior Developer role without manager keywords)
   - Verifies button is not rendered
2. ✅ `should NOT allow Employee (level=1) to create appraisal`
   - Tests level 1 access denial
3. ✅ `should deny access for level 0 (intern/trainee)`
   - Tests lowest level (0) access denial

**Expected Output:** System displays no UI elements for users below level 3 without manager role names.

---

### TC-B02.3: Reviewer Assignment Validation ✅

**Condition:** Reviewer must be different from Appraisee and Appraiser

**Tests Implemented:**

1. ✅ `should accept valid reviewer assignment (different from appraisee)`
   - Simulates API call with valid reviewer (ID=12, different from appraisee ID=10)
   - Verifies successful appraisal creation
   - Mock returns appraisal_id on success

**Expected Output:** Appraisal is created successfully with valid distinct IDs.

---

### TC-B02.3-N1: Invalid Reviewer Assignment ✅

**Condition:** Reviewer is same as Appraisee or Appraiser

**Tests Implemented:**

1. ✅ `should reject when reviewer_id equals appraisee_id`
   - Tests reviewer_id = appraisee_id = 10
   - Verifies API returns error: "Reviewer cannot be the same as Appraisee."
2. ✅ `should reject when reviewer_id equals appraiser_id`
   - Tests reviewer_id = appraiser_id = 100
   - Verifies API returns error: "Reviewer cannot be the same as Appraiser."

**Expected Output:** System displays appropriate error messages for invalid assignments.

---

### TC-B02.4: Complete Field Assignment ✅

**Condition:** Manager can assign all required fields during Appraisal creation

**Tests Implemented:**

1. ✅ `should validate all required fields are assignable`
   - Tests complete appraisal data submission
   - Required fields: appraisee_id, reviewer_id, appraisal_type_id
   - Optional fields: appraisal_type_range_id, period_start, period_end
   - Verifies all fields are present in created appraisal
2. ✅ `should reject appraisal creation with missing required fields`
   - Tests incomplete data (missing reviewer_id)
   - Verifies error: "Missing required fields"

**Expected Output:** Appraisal is created with all fields assigned when complete; rejected when incomplete.

---

## Additional Test Coverage

### Edge Cases and Security ✅

**4 additional tests for robustness:**

1. ✅ `should handle null user gracefully`
   - Tests behavior when user is not authenticated
   - Verifies no crash, renders nothing
2. ✅ `should handle undefined role level gracefully`
   - Tests missing emp_roles_level property
   - Ensures safe fallback behavior
3. ✅ `should handle null role level gracefully`
   - Tests explicit null emp_roles_level
   - Verifies proper handling of null values
4. ✅ `should prioritize role name over level when both present`
   - Tests user with "Manager" role but level=1
   - Verifies role name grants access despite low level
   - Documents precedence: role name > level

---

### Integration Tests ✅

**2 end-to-end workflow tests:**

1. ✅ `should allow complete appraisal creation workflow for manager`
   - Full workflow: render → verify button → click → verify success
   - Ensures no errors in complete interaction
2. ✅ `should prevent complete workflow for non-manager`
   - Verifies employees cannot access any part of workflow

## Key Implementation Details

### Role Authorization Logic

```typescript
const isManagerOrAbove = (roles?: string, level?: number | null) => {
  // Priority 1: Check role name pattern
  if (
    roles &&
    /manager|lead|head|director|vp|chief|cxo|cto|ceo|admin/i.test(roles)
  )
    return true;

  // Priority 2: Check hierarchy level
  if (typeof level === "number") return level > 2;

  return false;
};
```

**Recognized Manager Role Keywords:**

- Manager
- Lead
- Head
- Director
- VP (Vice President)
- Chief
- CXO, CTO, CEO
- Admin

**Level Requirements:**

- Level > 2 (i.e., level 3 or higher)
- Level 0-2: No access (unless role name matches)

### Mock Strategy

- **UI Components:** Radix Select mocked with native `<select>` elements (same as GoalWeightageCategory tests)
- **API Calls:** `apiFetch` mocked with configurable responses
- **Navigation:** `react-router-dom` mocked to prevent actual navigation
- **Toast Notifications:** `sonner` mocked to capture error/success messages

## Files Modified/Created

### Created

- `frontend/src/features/appraisal/__tests__/AppraisalCreationRBAC.test.tsx` (new file, 700+ lines)

### Dependencies Used

- `vitest` - Test framework
- `@testing-library/react` - Component testing utilities
- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation
- `react-router-dom` - Navigation (mocked)
- `sonner` - Toast notifications (mocked)

---

## Notes

1. **Role Name Priority:** The implementation prioritizes role name pattern matching over hierarchy level. A user with "Manager" in their role name will have access even with level=1.

2. **Backend Validation:** Tests for reviewer assignment validation (TC-B02.3, TC-B02.3-N1) simulate API responses. Actual enforcement happens on the backend.

3. **UI-Based Access Control:** The primary access control is UI-based (button visibility). Backend should also enforce authorization.

4. **Extensibility:** Test suite can easily be extended to cover:

   - Page-based tests (CreateAppraisal component)
   - Modal-based tests (CreateAppraisalModal component)
   - Additional role combinations
   - Department-based restrictions

5. **Maintenance:** When adding new recognized manager roles, update both:
   - `CreateAppraisalButton.tsx` (production code)
   - Test suite mock data and assertions

- [ ] Test appraisal creation with goals
- [ ] Test appraisal type and period selection
- [ ] Test reviewer eligibility filtering
- [ ] Test department-based restrictions
- [ ] Test concurrent appraisal creation
- [ ] Test edit vs create permission differences

### Integration with E2E
