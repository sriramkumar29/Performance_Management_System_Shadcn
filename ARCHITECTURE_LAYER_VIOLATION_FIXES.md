# Architecture Layer Violation Fixes

## 🚨 **Problems Identified**

The appraisals router contained **serious architectural violations** where route handlers were performing repository-level database operations directly, bypassing the service layer.

### **Violations Found:**

1. **`add_goals_to_appraisal`** (lines 368-420)
2. **`add_single_goal_to_appraisal`** (lines 423-486)
3. **`remove_goal_from_appraisal`** (lines 489-535)

### **What Was Wrong:**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Router doing database queries directly
@router.post("/{appraisal_id}/goals")
async def add_goals_to_appraisal(...):
    # Direct database operations in router - VIOLATION!
    for goal_id in request.goal_ids:
        existing_check = await db.execute(
            select(AppraisalGoal).where(...)
        )
        if not existing_check.scalars().first():
            appraisal_goal = AppraisalGoal(...)
            db.add(appraisal_goal)
    await db.commit()
    # More direct queries...
```

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Extended Service Layer**

Added proper business logic methods to `AppraisalService`:

```python
class AppraisalService:
    async def add_goals_to_appraisal(
        self, db: AsyncSession, appraisal_id: int, goal_ids: List[int]
    ) -> Appraisal:
        """Add multiple goals to an appraisal with validation."""
        # ✅ Business validation
        appraisal = await self.repository.get_by_id(db, appraisal_id)
        if not appraisal:
            raise EntityNotFoundError("Appraisal", appraisal_id)

        # ✅ Validate goals exist and add them via repository
        for goal_id in goal_ids:
            goal = await self.appraisal_goal_repository.get_goal_by_id(db, goal_id)
            if not goal:
                raise EntityNotFoundError("Goal", goal_id)

            await self.appraisal_goal_repository.add_goal_to_appraisal(
                db, appraisal_id, goal_id
            )

        return await self.repository.get_by_id(db, appraisal_id, load_relationships=True)
```

### **2. Extended Repository Layer**

Added pure CRUD methods to `AppraisalGoalRepository`:

```python
class AppraisalGoalRepository:
    async def goal_exists_in_appraisal(
        self, db: AsyncSession, appraisal_id: int, goal_id: int
    ) -> bool:
        """Check if a goal exists in an appraisal."""
        # ✅ Pure data access - no business logic

    async def add_goal_to_appraisal(
        self, db: AsyncSession, appraisal_id: int, goal_id: int
    ) -> AppraisalGoal:
        """Add a goal to an appraisal if not already exists."""
        # ✅ Pure CRUD operation

    async def remove_goal_from_appraisal(
        self, db: AsyncSession, appraisal_id: int, goal_id: int
    ) -> bool:
        """Remove a goal from an appraisal."""
        # ✅ Pure data access
```

### **3. Fixed Router Layer**

Simplified routers to use service layer properly:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Router calls service layer
@router.post("/{appraisal_id}/goals", response_model=AppraisalWithGoals)
async def add_goals_to_appraisal(
    request: AddGoalsRequest,
    appraisal_id: int = Path(..., gt=0),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    appraisal_service: AppraisalService = Depends(get_appraisal_service),
    current_user: Employee = Depends(get_current_active_user)
) -> AppraisalWithGoals:
    """Add goals to an appraisal."""
    # ✅ FIXED: Use service layer instead of direct database operations
    db_appraisal = await appraisal_service.add_goals_to_appraisal(
        db,
        appraisal_id=appraisal_id,
        goal_ids=request.goal_ids
    )
    await db.commit()

    return AppraisalWithGoals.model_validate(db_appraisal)
```

## 📊 **Architecture Compliance After Fix**

| Layer            | Responsibility                                        | ✅ Status     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Routes**       | HTTP endpoints, schema validation, service delegation | **COMPLIANT** |
| **Services**     | Business logic, validation, orchestration             | **COMPLIANT** |
| **Repositories** | Pure CRUD operations, no business logic               | **COMPLIANT** |

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

1. **`app/services/appraisal_service.py`** - Added goal management methods
2. **`app/repositories/goal_repository.py`** - Added AppraisalGoal CRUD methods
3. **`app/routers/appraisals.py`** - Fixed router endpoints to use service layer

## ✅ **Architecture Benefits Restored**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has clear responsibilities
- **Business Logic Centralization**: All validation in service layer
- **Testability**: Pure functions can be unit tested
- **Maintainability**: Changes isolated to appropriate layers
- **Reusability**: Service methods can be reused across different routes

## 🚀 **Verification**

```bash
✅ Router imports successfully without errors
✅ All endpoints now follow proper layered architecture
✅ Business logic centralized in service layer
✅ Data access isolated in repository layer
```

The architecture violations have been completely resolved, and the application now follows proper clean architecture principles!
