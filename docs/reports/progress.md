### ✅ 4. **Code Cleanup & Organization - COMPLETE**

**Status:** CODEBASE CLEANED AND ORGANIZED  
**Achievement:** Removed 20+ debug and duplicate test files while preserving all essential functionality

**🧹 Files Cleaned:**
- **Removed Debug Tests**: `debug-goal-templates.spec.ts`, `auth-debug-goal-templates.spec.ts`, etc.
- **Removed Duplicates**: `working-goal-template-integration.spec.ts`, `goal-template-seeded-data.spec.ts`
- **Removed Backend Debug**: `debug_test.py`, `debug_mock.py`, temporary verification files
- **Preserved All Seed Files**: All `seed_*.py` files maintained for data setup
