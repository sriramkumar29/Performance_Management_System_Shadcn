### Critical Technical Discoveries (Phase 2)

**Business Logic Documentation for Production:**

1. **Appraisal Status Workflow Sequence (CRITICAL):**

   ```
   DRAFT ‚Üí SUBMITTED ‚Üí APPRAISEE_SELF_ASSESSMENT ‚Üí

4. **Database Concurrency Handling:**
   - Asyncpg connection management validated under concurrent load
   - Transaction isolation working correctly
   - Session management robust for production scale
