## Specifications

### Validation Logic

#### Goal Template Validation

1. **Weightage Validation**:

   - Individual goal template weightage: 1-100%
   - No total weightage requirement at template level
   - Templates can be saved with any valid individual weightage
   - 100% total weightage validation occurs at appraisal level when goals are assigned

2. **Importance Validation**:

   - Must be one of: "High", "Medium", "Low"
   - Required field, cannot be null or empty

3. **Category Assignment**:
   - Multiple categories can be assigned to a single template
   - Categories must exist in the system before assignment or can be added

#### Appraisal Validation

1. **Role Assignment Validation**:

   - Appraiser must have manager role or level â‰¥ 3
   - Reviewer must be different from appraisee and appraiser
   - Appraisee cannot be their own appraiser or reviewer

2. **Goal Weightage Validation**:

   - Total goal weightage per appraisal must equal 100%
   - Individual goal weightage: 1-100%
   - Cannot submit appraisal without achieving 100% total weightage

3. **Status Transition Validation**:

   - Enforce strict workflow sequence
   - Validate user permissions for status changes
   - Prevent unauthorized status modifications

4. **Rating Validation**:
   - All ratings (self, appraiser, reviewer) must be 1-5
   - Ratings are optional until respective evaluation phase

### Processing Logic

#### Appraisal Lifecycle Workflow

1. **Draft Creation**:

   - Manager or authorized user creates appraisal with basic details
   - Assigns appraisee, appraiser (auto assign be self), and reviewer
   - Selects appraisal type and range if applicable
   - System automatically calculates period dates based on type and range
   - Frontend restricts creation to managers/users with role level > 2 or specific role names
   - Backend validates role assignments prevent conflicts (appraiser â‰  appraisee, reviewer â‰  appraisee/appraiser)

2. **Goal Assignment**:

   - Import from templates or create custom goals
   - Validate total weightage equals 100%
   - Goals become read-only after submission

3. **Status Progression**:

   ```
   Draft â†’ Submitted (Waiting Acknowledgement in UI) â†’ Appraisee Self Assessment â†’
   Appraiser Evaluation â†’ Reviewer Evaluation â†’ Complete
   ```

4. **Self Assessment Phase**:

   - Triggered when status = "Appraisee Self Assessment"
   - Employee provides ratings (1-5) and comments for each goal
   - Goals display as read-only during assessment
   - Advances to "Appraiser Evaluation" upon completion

5. **Appraiser Evaluation Phase**:

   - Triggered when status = "Appraiser Evaluation"
   - Appraiser sees self-assessment data as read-only
   - Provides appraiser ratings and comments per goal
   - Submits overall rating and comments
   - Advances to "Reviewer Evaluation"

6. **Reviewer Evaluation Phase**:
   - Triggered when status = "Reviewer Evaluation"
   - Reviewer sees all previous assessment data as read-only
   - Provides final reviewer rating and comments
   - Marks appraisal as "Complete"

#### Period Calculation Logic

1. **Automatic Date Calculation**:

   - Annual: Full calendar year or fiscal year
   - Half-yearly: 6-month periods (1st: Jan-Jun, 2nd: Jul-Dec)
   - Quarterly: 3-month periods (1st: Jan-Mar, 2nd: Apr-Jun, 3rd: Jul-Sep, 4th: Oct-Dec.)
   - Tri-annual: 4-month periods (1st: Jan-Apr, 2nd: May-Aug, 3rd: Sep-Dec)

2. **Date Override**:
   - System calculates default dates
   - Managers can manually adjust start/end dates if needed
   - Manual dates must fall within reasonable ranges

### Error Handling

#### Business Rule Violations

1. **Invalid Status Transition**:

   - Error: "Invalid status transition from [current] to [requested]"
   - HTTP Status: 400 Bad Request
   - Action: Display valid next states to user

2. **Insufficient Permissions**:

   - Error: "[Role] role required" or role-based access denied
   - HTTP Status: 403 Forbidden
   - Action: Redirect to appropriate view or display access denied message
   - Frontend implements role-based UI restrictions and navigation guards

3. **Weightage Validation Failures**:

   - Error: "Total weightage must be 100%, current: [X]%" or "Total weightage must be 100%, but got [X]%"
   - HTTP Status: 400 Bad Request (ValidationError/BusinessRuleViolationError)
   - Action: Highlight affected goals and show current total
   - Additional: "Total weightage would exceed 100%: current [X]% + new [Y]% = [Z]%" for goal additions

4. **Missing Required Data**:
   - Error: "Cannot submit appraisal: must have goals totalling 100% weightage"
   - HTTP Status: 400 Bad Request
   - Action: Guide user to complete required fields

#### Data Integrity Violations

1. **Invalid References**:

   - Error: "[Entity] with ID [X] not found" (e.g., "Employee with ID 123 not found")
   - HTTP Status: 404 Not Found (via EntityNotFoundError/DomainEntityNotFoundError)
   - Action: Return to previous valid state
   - Entities validated: Employee, Goal, Appraisal, Goal Template, Category, Appraisal Type, Appraisal Range

2. **Duplicate Resource Creation**:
   - Error: "[Entity] with name '[name]' already exists" (e.g., "Appraisal type with name 'Annual' already exists")
   - HTTP Status: 409 Conflict (via DuplicateResourceError)
   - Action: Suggest alternative names or update existing resource
   - Applied to: Appraisal types, Appraisal ranges, Employee emails

**Note**: The system does not currently implement duplicate appraisal period validation (employee having multiple active appraisals for the same period). Multiple appraisals can be created for the same employee across different periods without conflict checking.

### Field Mapping/Assignments

#### Goal Template to Goal Mapping

When importing from template:

- `temp_title` â†’ `goal_title`
- `temp_description` â†’ `goal_description`
- `temp_performance_factor` â†’ `goal_performance_factor`
- `temp_importance` â†’ `goal_importance`
- `temp_weightage` â†’ `goal_weightage`
- Template categories â†’ Goal category assignment
- `temp_id` â†’ `goal_template_id` (maintains template reference)

#### Appraisal Period Auto-Assignment

Based on appraisal type and range using comprehensive date calculation logic:

- **Annual/Project-end**: January 1 - December 31 (full calendar year)
- **Half-yearly**: 1st (Jan-Jun), 2nd (Jul-Dec)
- **Quarterly**: Q1 (Jan-Mar), Q2 (Apr-Jun), Q3 (Jul-Sep), Q4 (Oct-Dec)
- **Tri-annual**: 1st (Jan-Apr), 2nd (May-Aug), 3rd (Sep-Dec)
- **Annual-Probation**: Same as Annual but with different evaluation criteria
- Manual date override capability with validation constraints
- Leap year handling and month-end date adjustments

#### Authentication and Session Management

- JWT access tokens (short-lived) with refresh token mechanism
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Session persistence across browser sessions
- Unauthorized request handling with automatic logout
- Token validation with comprehensive error handling

#### Security Access Control Mapping

Status-based field visibility:

**Draft/Submitted Status**:

- Appraiser: Goals (editable)
- Appraisee/Reviewer: No access

**Self Assessment Status**:

- Appraisee: Goals (read-only) + self rating/comment fields (editable)
- Appraiser/Reviewer: No access (security restriction)

**Appraiser Evaluation Status**:

- Appraisee: No access (security restriction - completely blocked from viewing appraisal)
- Appraiser: Goals + self assessment (read-only) + appraiser rating/comment fields (editable)
- Reviewer: No access

**Reviewer Evaluation Status**:

- Appraisee: No access (security restriction - completely blocked from viewing appraisal)
- Appraiser: No access (security restriction)
- Reviewer: All data (read-only) + reviewer fields (editable)

**Complete Status**:

- All parties: Complete appraisal data (read-only)
- Maintains permanent record of all evaluations

### Audit Trail and Logging

#### Comprehensive Logging System
